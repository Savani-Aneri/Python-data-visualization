Visualization of temperature over the years across country & states to detect the presence of Global Warming using Jupyter Notebook

Global Warming is the phenomenon of increasing land, air, and ocean temperatures of Earth over the past couple of centuries. Human activities are acountable for this condition, primarily fossil fuel burning.
I have taken datasets GlobalTemperatures.csv, GlobalLandTemperatureByCountry.csv, GlobalLandTemperatureByStates.csv from Kaggle provided by Berkeley Earth Data Package.

I want to check change in temperatures over:

1) years

2) months

3) seasons

4) countrywise

5) statewise

My main focus will be to check if the cold is getting hotter is true.
